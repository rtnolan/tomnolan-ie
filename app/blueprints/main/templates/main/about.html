	<p> Hi there, my name is Tom, I'm a Software Engineer working out of the beautifully sunny Dublin, Ireland. My main 
		interests lie in all things Web Development (more backend than front) but I'm always open to learning new about
		and using new technologies.
		I created this blog with a couple of intentions in mind. I mainly want to use it as a platform to 
		write about things that I find interesting. I also want to use it as a means to showcase projects that I'm
		working on.</p>
	<p>Thanks for stopping by,<br/>

	Tom.
